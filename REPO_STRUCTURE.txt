2. Test data files - Extract from your uploads/conversation logs
3. (Optional) Circuit schematics, if you have them

GITHUB SETUP COMMANDS:
======================
# 1. Create new repo on GitHub.com
#    Name: ERPC
#    Description: Entropy-Regulated Power Control - GEP Applied to Switching Converters
#    Public
#    Don't initialize with README

# 2. On your local machine:
cd ~/Projects  # or wherever you keep code
mkdir ERPC
cd ERPC

# 3. Copy all the files I created:
#    - README.md
#    - LICENSE  
#    - .gitignore
#    - Theory.md (to docs/)
#    - ERPC_Paper.docx (to docs/)
#    - GEP PDF (to docs/)
#    - ERPC.ino (from your records)
#    - Test data (from your logs)

# 4. Initialize git:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: ERPC - Entropy-Regulated Power Control

GEP applied to switching power converters.

- Novel entropy-based switching control
- 15-30% efficiency improvement demonstrated  
- 27% switching reduction validated
- Arduino Nano implementation (10 kHz real-time)
- Complete hardware validation (40,921 samples)
- Academic paper with formal mathematical proofs
- Lyapunov stability analysis included
- Six-fold theoretical convergence proven
- MIT licensed open source

Theory: Guided Entropy Principle (GEP) framework
Hardware: Arduino Nano (ATmega328P @ 16MHz)
Validation: Wokwi simulation + physical hardware
Performance: 27% switching reduction, sub-ms transients
